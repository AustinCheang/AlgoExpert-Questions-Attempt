# AlgoExpert-Questions-Attempt

# Motivation

Hello, this is Austin. I am currently looking for jobs and therefore have been doing coding interview questions from different platforms such as Leetcode and AlgoExpert. This repo contains the questions I have done in AlgoExpert for personal use. 

The repo is structured into different problem categories such as ``Array``, `BinaryTrees` in AlgoExpert. For each question, I would attempt in `Python` and `Java`.
